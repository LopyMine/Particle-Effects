# (Neo)Forge Support
Particle Effects (and my other cool mods) will now support (Neo)Forge mod loader!

## Why?
All my mods were released exclusively for Fabric, as my projects always used Yarn mappings.

After the recent news about the end of support for Yarn mappings, it made sense to switch to the official Mojmap.

Since mappings are no longer an issue, it's fairly easy for me to add Neo(Forge) support.

## Which versions will be supported?
Only the main ones, the ones most played.

Currently, I plan to support:
- Forge: 1.20.1
- NeoForge: 1.20.1 1.21.1 1.21.10

If there are many requests to add another popular version to support, I (maybe) will add support for it.   

## Does this affect Fabric users?
Not really, it's the same for you; the highest priority is still given to Fabric support.
